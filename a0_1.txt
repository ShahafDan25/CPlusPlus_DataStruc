Assignment 0.1 - Computer Science 20 (txt file)

My name is Shahaf Dan, a second year computer science student at las Positas, and a full stack software engineer at Amber Systems Technologies. I am very passionate about technology and love to program and code. I hope to make the most out of this course.

- I am taking this class mainly because it is required for as a lower division course for transferrable credit as a computer science major student. I also take the courses because I dropped it in the fall, and I am coming back now to try it again and to succeed.

- I am planning to major in CS with emphasis on machine learning and data analytics and transfer to a four year institutions. My safety school is UC Davis, but if a better school will take me, I will go there.

- Last year, I came back after spending a week at Washington DC, and had a project due in three days in CS 20 (data structures). I started coding and within a few hours, my compiler crushed. I could not figure out what went wrong and tried downloading eclipse over and over again, but even this got complicated with the many versions eclipse has. I tried using other compilers too, which worked for the most part, but at that point it was too late and I got a 0 on my project.

- The best experience that I had was my interview for a front end web developer internship. Thanks to google, a few years ago I started teaching myself HTML, JavaScript and CSS, for fun because I found it interesting. In my interview they asked me to use the bootstrap API to code a simple web site GUI. It was the best technical experience that I had not just because I got the job, but also because I had fun.

- I do not have any concerns for this semester. I know the professor and have a mutual respect with him, and am already experienced with the course's materials and learned from my mistakes. I will even try to conduct an honors project for this class.
